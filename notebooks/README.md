# DEX Notebooks

Project with a collection of interactive notes and examples as Jupyter
notebooks to help with batch auction and solution visualization. Since Github
has built-in support for Jupyter IPython notebooks, you can view them directly
here :D.

## Table of Contents

1. [Market Maker and Limit Order](work/limit-order.ipynb)

## Running Locally

You can run a Jupyter Docker container to develop the notebooks locally with:
```
./docker-jupyter.sh
```
